# MyMakeupTrackerApp
Welcome to my Sinatra App! 

My Sinatra project allows a user to log in, sign up, and log out. Once an account is created, a user will then be able to create a new makeup brand entry, see all the brands they have previously entered, edit those brands, and delete brands from their list.  


# Installation
1. Clone the repo and cd into the my_makeup_tracker_app directory
2. Run bundle install to install the gem dependencies. 
3. Run a 'shotgun' server and copy the port number into a new browser.

# Usage
* Enter a valid username, email, and password to create an account.
* Create makeup brands that you prefer and then edit or delete them as needed.
* Login and logout as needed.

# License
The gem is available as open source under the terms of the MIT License.

# Code of Conduct
Everyone interacting in the MyMakeupTrackerApp projectâ€™s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the code of conduct.
