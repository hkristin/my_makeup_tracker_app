MyMakeupTrackerApp
Welcome to my Sinatra App! 

My Sinatra project allows a user to log in, sign up, and log out. Once an account is created, a user will then be able to create a new favorite makeup brand entry, see all the brands they have previously entered, edit those brands, and delete brands from their list. 

Installation
Clone the repo and cd into my_makeup_tracker_app directory, run bundle install to install the gem dependencies. Run shotgun server and copy the port number into a new browser.

Usage
Enter a valid username, email, and password to create an account.
Create brands that you prefer and then edit or delete them as needed.
Login and logout as needed.

License
The gem is available as open source under the terms of the MIT License.

Code of Conduct
Everyone interacting in the MyMakeupTrackerApp projectâ€™s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the code of conduct.
